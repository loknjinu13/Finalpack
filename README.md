Summary of My Linux Network Class

### Presented by Fongoh Loknjinu Atanga
### General Introduction
I have always loved the Linux platform but never understood how orderly and secured it was until this Linux Network Class.
This Class has improved my know how on command line executions, script writing, script analysis, Github contributions and Team work.
The following is a general summary of what i understood, executed, contributed, experienced and deployed during my studies.

### Introductory Weeks
- [Week1](https://github.com/loknjinu13/hello-world) - During this week we were introduced into the various environments which we will study. We had Github for publishing and collaborating in script/source code writing, D2L Brighspace for class assignments and lecture updates, virtual-box software to simulate OS distros and a need to obtain a Raspberry pi and Sandisk 3.1 Extreme USB with a minimum capacity of 32GB in order to install our desired Linux OS distribution. Our lecturer specified on Debian which he had tested but gave an opportunity for all to choose whatever will be appropriate and convenient to understand the lecture. 

We engaged in learning step by step the Github environment which permitted us to create our first repository **Hello World**.
- [Week2](https://github.com/loknjinu13/loknjinu13.github.io/blob/master/README.md) - 
Both of the following weeks were basic commands that I learned through the first couple weeks of the course such as updating, upgrading, partitions, remove files, and changing directories.

As assignment for week 2 i created my [first script](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week2/blob/master/week2.sh). This was interesting as I had a grasp of learning and writing using the terminal. Script writing was made simple as I learned to copy files and directories, move files and directories, delete , compress and append information into files.

- [Week3](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week4repos)- This was and interesting week as i had the opportunity to document how i could install git unto my Linux distro, clone a repository from github, git status, git add, git commit, git pull or push my contribution unto Github. This practice permitted me to push my [week3 scripts](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week4repos/blob/master/week3script) which focused on learning devices and creating an empty file or directory using **dd** command to later add information and inspecting this with **hexdump**.
- [Week 4](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week4scripts) - During this week i applied my past knowledge in creating a Swap file and using an html presentation for my script. This was external knowledge from [learning shell scripting](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).

I created my first ever persistence USB OS, after long hours of research, and had to document my work and was pleased to learn from classmates like [Pavel](https://github.com/paveldanek). 

I also had some knowledge on [how cache works](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/15/spectre-and-meltdown-how-cache-works/) which as explained by our lecturer is very vital for us to understand in order to know how to manage our various programs running in our systems as SysAdmins.

### HARDWORK BEGINS
- [Week 5 and 6](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Week6) - I used Ubuntu as my Linux distribution. I also documented on how to [add a usb in your virtual-box session](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Week6/blob/master/usb_virtualbox.md). 
I learnt on debootstrap and Qemu setup, which are essential in installing OS depending on the environment you want to install the instance.

I learned on the grub environment and its importance to the OS, as well as were to obtain necessary log files in order to diagnose system errors using kern.log. 
 

- [Week7](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Week7) - I studied more on using Markdown as a documentation tool. Wrote an essay on [Software engineering](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Week7/blob/master/Essay.md) which greatly inspired me on core principles. 

I also learnt how to check on my runlevel.

- [Midterm](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week8) -  This was a summary of all i had learnt in this course.

### Core Application
- [Week 9 and 10](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Chapter9-10) - This was learning on networking concepts and how to use the various commands. I learnt on the **/etc/passwd** and **/etc/shadow** files as [Jorge](https://github.com/Joval14/Week8-review/blob/master/Lab6.sh) my classmate explained their importance. 
- [Week 11] This was basically my reviews of my midterm script which i corrected as per directions from my classmates. 
- [Week 12](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Week12) - I read about how the internet works and understood how tcpdump works. 

### Team Project 
- [Week 13](https://github.com/loknjinu13/Week13) - This was the period of preparing our deployment environment, research and more focus on team contributions for our minecraft server.
- [Week 14](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week14) - I studied C as a compiling program and compiled [mycfile.c](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week14/blob/master/mycfile.c). 

I also practiced on changing my Windows Manager by using [fluxbox](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week14/blob/master/fluxbox.md). 

- [Week 15](https://github.com/loknjinu13/week15) - This week was focused on reviewing our course project and practicing on using C and Python in compilation. Our team successfully deployed our minecraft server and documented. We also edited our codeBlockers.html credit to team [N-Artica](https://sootsplash.csci2461.com/nartica.html).

### "Code-Blockers"
This project was very interesting as I came to finally research and manage a service on a Linux Server. Working as a team was fascinating in accomplishing this project. Some realities of projects come to light as I came to understand that _No One Man Can Claim To Know It All without even a dime contribution from another_ . Thanks Team.

I also learned, social media is a distraction in this field and we must find ways to limit our presence by collecting only important information needed while focusing on our careers as SysAdmins.

More special thanks goes to my lecturer Matthew J Harmon who simplified the myth of Linux by making us to work hard by doing it ourselves and learning not to be introverts in project realisation leading us to build a portfolio for ourselves and our future lectures at Saint Paul College for a wonderful IT career.
